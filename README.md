## Description
The project shown is an analysis of CGK Products Amazon account. Our purpose is to show different ways to improve Profit and ROI percentage and find ways improve sales. The following questions were used for the analysis in order to obtain our desired result.
- What is better, higher ROI or higher profit and which is a better parameter?
- Should we sell fewer higher ticket items (high profit) or more lower ticket items (higher ROI)?
- What type of item we sell at a loss (where profit is under 2$)?
- Which suppliers make us the most money (total/average profit)?
- When should we spend money on advertisement?
- What are the percentages of products that we sell at a profit?

## Results
Some recommendations to improve sales would be to purchase items that are more expensive with higher ROI. Stop purchasing items with lower margins because when the price drops the amount of profit quickly reduces to under $2, which would make the product not profitable. Another recommendation would be to advertise during January, February, and March where sales are the slowest. This would help create sales and improve cash flow. I would also focus on purchasing through the main suppliers Vera Bradley, Nike, Under Armour, and Publix as that is where the majority of the profits comes from.
